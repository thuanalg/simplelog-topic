### **Performance Highlights: Speed and Efficiency**

One of the core objectives of SimpleLog-Topic is to provide exceptional **performance** while maintaining **simplicity**. Here’s a detailed look at its performance in different scenarios:

#### **Benchmarking Performance**

1. **Windows10/MSVC 2022 with 10 Threads and 10 Million Records:**

   - **SimpleLog-Topic:** **16 seconds** (https://github.com/thuanalg/simplelog-topic/blob/main/MSVC-2022-performance.txt)
   - **spdlog:** **66 seconds**

   In this test, **SimpleLog-Topic** logged **10 million records** in just **16 seconds**, compared to **66 seconds** taken by **spdlog**. This demonstrates **4x faster performance** in multithreaded environments, showing that SimpleLog-Topic efficiently manages logging tasks without unnecessary performance bottlenecks.

2. **Linux Performance Benchmark (10 Threads and 10 Million Records):**

   - **SimpleLog-Topic:** **15-16 seconds**
   - **spdlog:** **15 seconds** (https://github.com/thuanalg/simplelog-topic/blob/main/LinuxCentOs09-performance.txt)

   On **Linux**, both SimpleLog-Topic and spdlog performed similarly, completing the test in **16 seconds**. This consistency across platforms demonstrates that SimpleLog-Topic provides **reliable performance** in both Windows and Linux environments.

3. **Large-Scale Logging Test (1 Billion Records, 10 Threads):**

   - **Time Taken:** **36 minutes and 3 seconds** (**2163 seconds**)
   - **Log Size:** **113 GB** or refer to another case: (https://github.com/thuanalg/simplelog-topic/blob/main/One_Billion_records-performance.txt)

   In an extreme scenario, SimpleLog-Topic processed **1 billion records** across **10 threads**, generating **113 GB of log data** in just **36 minutes**. This performance indicates that SimpleLog-Topic can scale to handle **massive volumes** of log data, making it suitable for both **high-frequency** and **large-scale logging** applications.
